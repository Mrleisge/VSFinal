        <p>Crash Bandicoot: an unforgettable name, right? Originally created by Naughty Dog in 1996 for the PlayStation 1, this game skyrocketed into the hearts of gamers everywhere. Fast forward to the PlayStation 3 era, and it got remastered. For me, it’s even more personal – it was the first game I ever played, and it's no wonder Crash became one of PlayStation's most beloved icons throughout the '90s!</p><br>
        <p>The Crash Bandicoot Series didn’t stop at just one hit game – it exploded with a collection of 8 mainstream titles that captured hearts and minds across the globe:<br>
        
            Crash Bandicoot (1996)<br>
            Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back (1997)<br>
            Crash Bandicoot: Warped (1998)<br>
            Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex (2001)<br>
            Crash Twinsanity (2004)<br>
            Crash of the Titans (2007)<br>
            Crash: Mind Over Mutant (2008)<br>
            Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time (2020)<br>
            And that’s not even the full story! When you throw in the racing spinoffs, party games, handheld titles, and remasters, we’re looking at 24 titles.</p><br>
        <p>So, why did Crash Bandicoot capture so many gamers’ hearts? It combined the best of both worlds! While staying true to the roots of classic side-scrolling platformers, it went all-in on the 3D experience, the hilarious death animations. Not to mention the vibrant, eye-popping worlds that kept you coming back for more.</p><br>
        <p>Fans couldn’t get enough of all the fun features, like collecting those precious Wumpa Fruits (who doesn’t love a good fruit haul?), conquering bonus levels for that extra thrill, and of course, Aku Aku – the trusty wooden mask spirit who’s there to lend a hand in your adventure.</p>
        <p>The main characters are:<br>
            Crash Bandicoot - The main protagonist and the player character.<br>
            Coco Bandicoot - Crash's younger sister and a playable character in some games.<br>
            Dr. Neo Cortex - The main antagonist.<br>
            Aku Aku - The wooden mask spirit who helps Crash.<br>
            Uka Uka - The evil counterpart to Aku Aku.</p>
